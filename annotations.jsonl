{"id":400,"text":"While I am in the United States, I should like first of all, on behalf of the leadership and the people of Russia, to express profound condolences to the Government and the people of the United States of America following the tragic death of the crew of the space shuttle Columbia. We share the grief of our American partners, with whom we are actively cooperating in outer space, primarily in the implementation of the international space station project.\n\nThe work of the astronauts is probably the best demonstration of the shared fundamental interests of humankind and of the need to pool our intellectual and creative efforts in the name of the progress of civilization.\n\nRussia views today's meeting in the context of the consistent efforts of the Security Council to find a political settlement to the situation surrounding Iraq, on the basis of complete and scrupulous compliance with the relevant resolutions.\n\nThe unanimous adoption of Security Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the deployment of international inspectors in Iraq have demonstrated the ability of the international community to act together in the interests of attaining a common goal. We are convinced that maintaining the unity of the world community, primarily within the context of the Security Council, and our concerted action, in strict compliance with the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the Security Council, are the most reliable means of resolving the problem of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq through political means.\n\nThere is no doubt that we all want to resolve this problem. It was with that in mind that we listened very closely to the presentation given by Secretary of State Powell. Russia continues to believe that the Security Council - and, through it, the entire international community - must have all of the information it needs in order to determine whether or not there are remaining weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\nThe information given to us today definitely will require very serious and thorough study. Experts in our countries must immediately begin to analyse it and then draw the appropriate conclusions. The main point is that this information must immediately be handed over for processing by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including through direct on-site verification during the inspections in Iraq.\n\nBaghdad must give the inspectors answers to the questions that we heard in the presentation given by the United States Secretary of State. We appeal once again to all States immediately to hand over to the international inspectors any information that can help them discharge their responsible mandate.\n\nThe information provided today by the United States Secretary of State once again convincingly indicates that the activities of the international inspectors in Iraq must be continued. They alone can say to what extent Iraq is complying with the demands of the Security Council. They alone can help the Security Council work out and adopt carefully balanced decisions - the best possible decisions.\n\nThe statements made by Mr. Blix and by Mr. ElBaradei in this very Chamber on 27 January show that a unique inspection mechanism has been deployed in Iraq which has everything it needs to ensure compliance with resolution 1441 (2002) and other Security Council resolutions. This great potential must be used to the fullest.\n\nThe Security Council and all its members must do everything they can to support the inspection process.\nRussia, for its part, intends to continue actively to promote the creation of the best possible conditions for the work of the international inspectors in Iraq. In particular, we are prepared to provide an aircraft for aerial monitoring and, if need be, additional inspectors as well.\n\nRussia welcomes the continuation of dialogue between the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director General of the IAEA with Iraq on outstanding unresolved issues. We hope that this dialogue will be extremely concrete and productive. It is facilitated, inter alia, by the fact that work has been carried out according to the timetable set out in resolution 1284 (1999), which should make the international inspections and monitoring even more systematic and effective, especially with respect to clarifying key disarmament tasks by the end of March of this year.\n\nIt is perfectly obvious that the work of UNMOVIC and the IAEA can be effective only with full cooperation in good faith from Iraq. Iraq should be the first to be concerned about providing definitive clarity on the question of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. That is the only way to reach a political settlement, including the lifting of the sanctions on Iraq. Baghdad should fully realize how crucial this is and do everything in its power so that the international inspectors can carry out their mandate.\n\nRecently, we have often heard the expression that time is running out for a settlement to the question of Iraq. Of course, resolution 1441 (2002) aims to quickly achieve practical results, but it does not set out any concrete time frame. The inspectors alone can advise the Security Council on how much time they need to carry out the tasks entrusted to them. In this respect, we cannot rule out the possibility that at some stage the Security Council may need to adopt a new resolution, or perhaps more than one resolution. The main point is that our efforts should continue to be aimed at doing everything possible to facilitate the inspection process, which has proven its effectiveness and which makes it possible to implement Council decisions by peaceful means.\n\nUnfortunately, the current situation concerning Iraq is far from being the last problem whose solution we will all still have to work on. The international community of the twenty-first century is confronting new global threats and challenges requiring a unified response from all States. A graphic example of that approach was the creation of the broad coalition to combat the primary and most dangerous threat of our time: international terrorism. It is precisely because of the unity of the world community that initial success has been achieved in combating that scourge. However, it is perfectly obvious that we are only beginning a very difficult battle with terrorism. And the information from the United States Secretary of State about the activities of Al Qaeda is further corroboration of that fact.\n\nThe unity of the world community will continue to be the principal guarantee of the effectiveness of the world's action. It is precisely unity that is essential in our approach to all problems, however complicated they may be. Tactical differences may arise, it is true.\nAnd probably there will be quite a few of them, given the complexity of the tasks we need to resolve. But they must not overshadow the strategic goals that are in the interests of our common security and stability.\n\n","year":2003,"speech_no":8,"meeting_no":4701,"speaker":"Mr. Ivanov","gender":"M","language":"Russian","country":"Russian Federation","topic":"Iraq-Kuwait","conflict":"Iraq","label":[[118,146,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[226,238,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[282,300,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[497,519,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[1046,1118,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[1420,1443,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[1534,1592,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[1705,1732,"Affect-security-positive"],[1952,2041,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[2834,2856,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[3030,3049,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[3090,3118,"Appreciation-balance-positive"],[3125,3148,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[3251,3278,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[3657,3685,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[3865,3909,"Affect-satisfaction-positive"],[4033,4040,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4078,4101,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[4302,4336,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[4564,4604,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[5555,5580,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[5733,5746,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[5986,6020,"Appreciation-balance-negative"],[6597,6620,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[6695,6704,"Appreciation-impact-positive"]]}

{"id":404,"text":"May I at the outset congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January this year.\n\nI should also like warmly to welcome the Foreign Minister of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Martino, with whose country Yugoslavia has had a long history of friendly and good neighbourly relations.\n\nThe decision that the Security Council is about to take on the extension of the partial suspension of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is a thoroughly inadequate response to the great efforts and contribution that Yugoslavia has been making in the search for a just and lasting solution to the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nAs is well known, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has fulfilled all the obligations and met all the conditions set by the relevant Security Council resolutions by which the sanctions regime was established. In addition, Yugoslavia has accepted the peace plan of the Contact Group on Bosnia and Herzegovina, as it has accepted all the other peace proposals, and has done everything in its power to influence the Bosnian Serbs to do the same.\n\nIn this framework, my Government has consistently fulfilled its commitment to sever all political and economic contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership. This has been clearly confirmed by the reports of the Co-Chairmen of the Steering Committee of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, which have certified that the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is continuing to meet its commitment to close the border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Srpska.\nTherefore, the decision by the Council to extend only the very limited partial suspension of the sanctions for just another 100 days and to put forward new conditionalities and restrictions is certainly very disappointing. It reflects a lack of political will to assess objectively the positive and constructive role of the Federal Republic of   Yugoslavia in the search for a peaceful solution to the civil war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It ignores the fact that the decision to close the border with the Bosnian Serbs was a unilateral one, for which the Yugoslav Government asked for the assistance of the Mission of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia.\n\nReferences in the draft resolution concerning the export of products from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to the Krajina Serbs have absolutely nothing to do with the primary objective of the closure of the border, which is to influence the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact Group's peace plan. It represents an attempt to impose new conditions on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is unacceptable. The draft resolution, in fact, is not a mere extension of the partial suspension of the sanctions, but actually calls for the cessation of practically all economic relations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Krajina Serbs. Moreover, it seeks to exact an indirect recognition of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is unacceptable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before the overall political solution to the crisis has been found and accepted by all parties concerned. This approach is counter-productive and harmful, particularly in this delicate phase of the peace process, which is demonstrating some signs of progress.\n\nBy opting again to maintain the greatest part of sanctions against Yugoslavia, the Security Council is in fact playing into the hands of the extremist elements in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, thus continuing to encourage the war option.\nThis, of course, fuels the ambitions of the hardline Bosnian Muslim leadership, which feels that the continuation of the sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Serb nation as a whole is the shortest way to realize its extremist political goals. At the same time, the perpetuation of the sanctions also strengthens the hand of the Serb extremists, who argue that, no matter what the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is doing, the sanctions will remain in place and therefore the war option should be pursued.\n\nThat the sanctions have never managed to accomplish the goals they were imposed for in the first place, except to severely punish the most vulnerable segments of the population, was unambiguously stated in the Secretary-General's \"Supplement to An Agenda for Peace\"\n(S\/1995\/1). By making a decision to lift or substantially alleviate the sanctions, the Council would marginalize those extremist positions and would indeed make a significant contribution to the peace process.\n\nUnfortunately, in the past hundred days the very limited suspension of the sanctions established by Security Council resolution 943 (1994) has also not been entirely fulfilled. Despite a clear call by that resolution to the sanctions Committee to adopt appropriate streamlined procedures for expediting its consideration of applications concerning legitimate humanitarian assistance, the Committee has in fact resorted to an ever stricter implementation of the sanctions. Due to the inflexible positions of some delegations, the Committee consistently rejected requests for the export of gas for humanitarian purposes to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, even though all conditions concerning the monitoring and control by the World Health Organization of the consumption of the gas were met. The sanctions Committee has also steadfastly refused to allow the import into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of raw materials for the pharmaceutical industry, which is a necessary precondition for the regular supply of medicaments to the population. The Security Council for its part has ignored the request of the Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for the one-shot export of $70 million worth of goods, whose proceeds would have been used for the import of emergency humanitarian products.\n\nFurthermore, even though resolution 943 (1994)\nclearly allowed all civilian passenger flights to and from Belgrade Airport, it has not yet been possible to purchase or even make reservations for tickets from United States territory to Belgrade, a matter about which the Mission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia informed the Chairman of the sanctions Committee in its letter of 31 October 1994.\nAs the Council has now decided to extend the partial suspension of the sanctions, it is to be hoped that these shortcomings and flaws in the interpretation of resolution 943 (1994) will be overcome.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is convinced that the plan of the Contact Group, as a basis for the continuation of the peace process, is the rational and viable way to end the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina   and to establish a just and lasting solution. For its part, it is prepared to continue to make efforts towards that end.\n\nIn this framework, any linking of the further suspension of sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to conditions that were not valid at the time when the sanctions were imposed, or have no connection with the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, cannot be acceptable. By pursuing this policy, the Security Council in fact continues the practice of punishing the citizens of a sovereign country for events over which it has no control, which is a definite abuse of Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and is highly inhumane.\n\nIn spite of the fact that the Security Council has failed so far to properly weigh the constructive role that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has been playing with regard to the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia will continue to pursue the option of a peaceful, negotiated settlement, which it continues to believe is the only one possible and which it is convinced is in the best interests of all the peoples of the Balkan region.\n\nI would like to offer the following comments in connection with some of the statements made during the debate. My delegation categorically rejects the untrue and malicious allegations made by certain delegations. The situation in the former Yugoslavia is far too serious for the Council to be manipulated in order to satisfy the domestic and political propaganda needs of certain countries. Those delegations that have again chosen to put forward such allegations have thus clearly shown that they are not striving to reach a just and lasting peaceful solution.\n\nI must admit that my delegation is surprised and disappointed that the Security Council did not grant its request to sit at the Council table throughout the discussion of this item, which exclusively refers to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It is all the more incomprehensible why the Council decided to make this precedent, when such a request was granted in the past. I should like to believe that the Security Council reached such a decision in particular circumstances, and that it is only an unwanted exception, which will not be repeated.\n\n","year":1995,"speech_no":14,"meeting_no":3487,"speaker":"Mr. Djokic","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"-","topic":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — Sanctions","conflict":"Yugoslavia","label":[[0,36,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[141,177,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[290,340,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[503,533,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[541,571,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[624,649,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1304,1323,"Judgement-veracity-positive"],[1851,1869,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[1883,1907,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2720,2732,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[3073,3086,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[3231,3278,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3496,3545,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[3704,3738,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[3900,3925,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[4318,4365,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4666,4678,"Appreciation-balance-positive"],[4705,4841,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[4843,5136,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[5494,5513,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[6001,6038,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[6485,6509,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[7461,7476,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[7509,7561,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[7746,7779,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[8040,8075,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[8076,8111,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[8422,8489,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[8510,8553,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[8737,8773,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[8994,9012,"Judgement-normality-negative"]]}

We were shocked and appalled by the disproportionate use of force, in particular the use of heavy weapons, by the Israel Defence Forces and by police against Palestinian civilians, which claimed the lives of more than 60 people, including Palestinian children, and left more than 1,500 people wounded or injured. We are similarly shocked by the casualties on the Israeli side.\n\nI would like to add my voice to that of delegations that expressed their condolences to the families of all those who have been killed and wounded in these tragic events. We are hopeful that the ceasefire, which has been in place since dawn today, will hold, helping to prevent further loss of life and injuries among the civilian population.\n\nMy country strongly condemns all acts of violence and aggression by whomsoever committed.\nWe urge the parties to stop the hostilities, to refrain from unilateral provocative actions and to persevere in their efforts aimed at reaching a final settlement agreement as soon as possible. The lives of innocent civilians should remain an absolute priority. In this connection, we call on Israel to ensure full respect for the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Palestinian territories.\n\nUkraine has always been supportive of the Middle East peace process, which is based on the relevant United Nations resolutions and the principles laid down at the Madrid Peace Conference. We are convinced that the Palestinian and Israeli sides have no alternative but to complete the implementation of the Madrid peace process formula, which is based on Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973), as well as on the principle of land for peace.\n\nIt is also our firm belief that the political wisdom and far-sightedness of the Israelis and Palestinians will eventually help them reach a mutually acceptable compromise on such sensitive issues as the fate of the Holy City of Jerusalem and other permanent status issues. Ukraine hopes that, as a result of the strenuous efforts of the two sides, the Palestinian people will at long last find themselves in a position to exercise in full its right to self-determination and statehood.\n\nWe look forward to the forthcoming Israeli-Palestinian summits, to take place in Paris and Cairo.\nMy country welcomes the readiness of France and Egypt to host these important events at such a critical moment.

Let me also acknowledge the capable and faithful commitment of the Permanent Representative of Rwanda to the position of the President of the Security Council for the previous month, and let me finally acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, a country that is a neighbour and friend of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and welcome him to this Chamber.\n\nThe Security Council has before it a draft resolution, contained in document S\/ 1995\/21, to extend for another hundred days the easing of sanctions methodology adopted under resolution 943 (1994), of 23 September 1994, with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).\n\n  The lessons of the last one hundred days compel us not to repeat the same mistakes, for none of the stated objectives behind resolution 943 (1994) have been realized.\n\nAt the same time, unfortunately, resolution 943 (1994)\nhas set in motion a course that today is most difficult to reverse. Our attempt will be not to acquiesce in this course, or the mistakes, but to maximize what can be salvaged from what is clearly an effort that is quickly taking on water.\n\nResolution 943 (1994) was adopted, by less than a unanimous vote, to achieve at least the following stated goals: First, to encourage the so-called Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact Group peace plan by rewarding the Belgrade regime for perceived steps to cut off and further isolate the so-called Bosnian or Pale Serbs.\n\nSecondly, to limit the resources available to the so-called Bosnian Serbs to continue their military campaigns and aggression in lieu of accepting this peace.\n\nThirdly, to encourage the Belgrade regime to take further steps to create an environment suitable for a durable and just peace and reverse the consequences of Belgrade's pivotal role as an aggressor against the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nI am afraid that we can all agree that none of those objectives have been realized. In fact, on the contrary, there is evidence that there are counter-productive consequences.\nThe reasons for this are many.\n\nCertainly, we can argue that the motivations of some who supported resolution 943 (1994), and, most importantly, the methodology established under it, were not consistent with the stated goals and objectives.\n\nThe mechanisms established pursuant to resolution 943 (1994) to monitor the border and implement the resolutions's stated objectives were flawed and inadequate from their inception. These established mechanisms ensured compliance by their inadequacy to witness and report non-compliance.\n\nAs a consequence, the Belgrade regime could usurp over-extended international observers to continue to echo its claim of no responsibility, while in fact continuing to fuel the fire that it had started in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the way, I do not use the word \"fuel\"\nhere just as an analogy. It was the very fuel transported under the blind supervision of the Co-Chairmen of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) that allowed the allied so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs to carry out their aggression against the Bihac region, occupy its safe area and cause danger, suffering and even death to United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) personnel.\n\nEffectively, a Security Council resolution has been hijacked to subvert its own stated objectives, to undermine other Security Council resolutions and mandates and to endanger the security of United Nations personnel.\n\nNone the less, we do not wish to associate only negative and subversive motives to resolution 943 (1994), for we believe that many who supported its adoption did so sincerely.\n\nIt is in this spirit that we welcome the elements of the draft resolution that are designed to strengthen the effectiveness of the border monitoring mission and its reporting methodology.\n\nWe also welcome the most obvious - but apparently not to all - clarification requiring that any transshipment of goods or personnel through or to the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia requires the approval of their respective Governments. This would appear to be a most basic element of respect for international law, but apparently not for those who have placed their persona above the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the two Republics as well as the authority of the Security Council's resolutions, in particular resolution 820 (1993).\n\nWith respect to the language in the draft resolution, we would like to clarify that our Republic concurs with all shipments of essential humanitarian supplies consistent with our territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n\nUnfortunately, though, our endorsement of the changes and improvements on resolution 943 (1994) must be tempered by the following factors.\n\nFirst, can the methodology of border monitoring -or, more accurately, reporting on border monitoring - be corrected, if in fact, there is a most basic design flaw?\nAlthough we can endorse the stated objectives behind the resolution, we must continue to question its application.\n  Therefore, we recommend that the next time the methodology comes before the Council for review - on or before 21 April 1995 - the Council should establish a new methodology that: first, no longer monitors the Serbians that are supposed to be monitoring the border, but actually monitors the border; secondly, provides the international monitoring force with adequate resources and manpower, certainly more than the couple of hundred people now lightly equipped to actually observe a border of approximately 500 kilometres; and, thirdly, is properly delegated under an appropriate command structure and authority consistent with a mandate designed to truly seal or monitor the border.\n\nThe current methodology established to deter violations of the Bosnian border with Serbia is nonsensical.\nIt is analogous to allowing the rats to guard the cheese from the mice while a near-sighted cat is asked to report as to how much cheese is being taken and who is stealing it.\nThe logic of this methodology only becomes clear once we understand that it is the rat who is dictating the terms to provide an alibi and demonstrate his innocence. Although the effectively blind cat can even smell the cheese on the rat's breath, it cannot report that it has actually seen the rat stealing the cheese.\n\nThe Security Council really should not be brought to the level of being dictated to by the rat, who has already even admitted previous treachery, and it can certainly afford to ensure that the cat at least has glasses.\n\nSecondly, the Security Council cannot continue 100 days hereafter to further reward the Belgrade regime with another easing of sanctions, unless the Belgrade regime takes the most basic step to start to reverse the perverse ideology of a Greater Serbia, which it has initiated and still nurtures.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) should not be allowed in the future to benefit from the self-serving claim that it is promoting peace with its neighbours until it recognizes the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours - the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the other former Yugoslav Republics.\n\nFailure to recognize its neighbours and continue the status quo indefinitely allows the Belgrade regime to plead one case to the international audience, but, in fact, to maintain its ultra-nationalist credentials and still fuel the vision of a Greater Serbia.\n\nFinally, the overall peace process that is in theory to be supported by the draft resolution is moribund as long as the so-called Croatian Serbs continue to conduct cross-border aggression against, and to occupy parts of, the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Bihac region.\nThis violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina has been directly facilitated by the misuse of resolution 943 (1994)\nand the delusions that led to its adoption.\n\nThe so-called Croatian and Bosnian Serbs could not have executed their coordinated assault against the Bihac safe area and region without the fuel and other supplies that were transported to the attackers as part of the misuse of the monitoring mission established pursuant to resolution 943 (1994) or, in fact, in direct avoidance of it.\n\nCertainly, one must also wonder to what extent we are to be led to further delusions in believing that the so-called Croatian Serbs could have become full accomplices in the coordinated assault on Bihac without at least the acquiescence, if not the outright support, of Belgrade.\n\nNo matter what delusions may have been behind the course set out by resolution 943 (1994), and no matter what faults may endanger the very seaworthiness of the vessel, it is a ship that has been set sailing by the Security Council and therefore on which we are passengers, unwitting or otherwise. We therefore do not look to drill holes in the hull of this ship. On the contrary, we will look, as any passenger would, to bale out water, plug the leaks and keep the course steady.\n\nHowever, the Security Council must take the responsibility of ensuring that the objectives of resolution 943 (1994) are being advanced and that the holes are being adequately plugged, or the ship must reverse course, with the realization that this effort by the Council was at least premature.\n\nJust one final warning as we embark on the next 100 days: the rats are already abandoning ship.\n\n","year":1995,"speech_no":2,"meeting_no":3487,"speaker":"Mr. Sacirbey","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Bosnia and Herzegovina)'","topic":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — Sanctions","conflict":"Yugoslavia","label":[[42,49,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[105,137,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[144,160,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[165,185,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[251,274,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[274,310,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[437,464,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[523,564,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[612,619,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[1005,1022,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1125,1139,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[1180,1229,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[1540,1564,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1692,1723,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1776,1799,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1988,2013,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[2045,2084,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2134,2146,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[2277,2308,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[2371,2549,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2552,2732,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2953,2979,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[3008,3042,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[3190,3212,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[3547,3632,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[3768,3929,"Judgement-veracity-positive"],[3957,3967,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4120,4136,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4412,4432,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[4495,4595,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[4781,4801,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4916,4929,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[5184,5218,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[6022,6126,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[6128,6198,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[6205,6223,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[6377,6467,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[6478,6621,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[6624,6718,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[6773,6841,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[6858,6980,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[7142,7302,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[7486,7549,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[7669,7698,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[7755,7851,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[7867,7891,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[8164,8192,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[8208,8242,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[8249,8285,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[8692,8716,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[9034,9096,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[9163,9227,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[9246,9345,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[9360,9405,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[9700,9736,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"]]}
{"id":407,"text":"It is certainly right that we should be discussing this item at this time. We and all of our partners in the European Union have been shocked by the violence in Jerusalem, elsewhere in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and in Israel in the past few days.\n\nWe deplore the catastrophic loss of life and are horrified in particular by the deaths of innocent children. It is alarming how quickly in this theatre of tension the recourse to violence can get so out of hand.\nThose who have been fuelling the violence of the last few days are people who want to derail the peace process, and they cannot be allowed to succeed.\n\nThese tragic events bring home the need for a new urgency in resolving the outstanding issues in the Middle East peace process. It is vital that the violence come to an end so that peace talks can get under way again. In that regard, we welcome the talks that the United States Secretary of State will host in Paris tomorrow between Prime Minister Barak and President Yasser Arafat and those that President Mubarak of Egypt will host in Cairo on Thursday, 5 October. There needs to be a return to diplomacy and negotiation.\n\nThe Middle East region needs to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace to benefit all its peoples.

{"id":408,"text":"\nMr. President, let me begin by offering my most sincere compliments on the dynamic and authoritative way in which you are presiding over the work of the Security Council in the month of January.\n\nFor me it is a special honour and a source of deep satisfaction to deliver my country's first statement in the Security Council, a body that has taken on a pivotal role in managing the complex and treacherous international balances that emerged with the end of the cold war. On this occasion I reaffirm Italy's active and ongoing commitment to the Council's work of maintaining international peace and security amidst the tumult and strife of this new page of history.\n\nIn a century beset by terrible conflagrations, the Bosnian crisis has the unenviable distinction of being one of the worst of them. It has lasted over 30 months, and it has had a tremendous impact on public opinion - all the more so in Italy, where these dramatic events are happening right on our doorstep.\n\nHowever much has been done in these years to settle this crisis, even more remains to be done. On the positive side, the protagonists of the conflict have been brought to the negotiating table. A massive humanitarian effort has helped to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population.\nTo the greatest extent possible, a spillover of the conflict has been avoided. Finally, the parties have been persuaded to sign a cease-fire agreement, and an agreement for a complete cessation of hostilities effective as of 1 January. We fervently hope that they will fully comply, so as to allow the negotiations to be resumed and brought to a swift and successful conclusion.\n\nWe are quite hopeful that the recent agreements will be fully implemented, and provide a solid and permanent foundation on which to relaunch and revitalize the negotiations. We must immediately build on this achievement by strongly encouraging the parties to return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, lest we lose momentum or even undermine seemingly consolidated results.\n\nBut let us not lose sight of our long-term goals: a lasting peace, stability in the region and the region's introduction into the fold of the free, democratic, and   prosperous commonwealth of European nations. These goals remain absolute priorities for the international community. Together with other members of the international community, we will work patiently and with perseverance towards these ends.\n\nSanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) have proved effective, inducing Belgrade to accept the logic of negotiations. But it was the prospect of suspending and alleviating sanctions that convinced Belgrade to cooperate with the peace process by pressuring the Bosnian Serbs to accept the proposed peace plan, which has already been accepted by the Government of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are convinced that any feasible peace strategy must include Belgrade. Therefore, if we want to maintain our leverage with Belgrade at this stage we must be flexible in our approach to sanctions through a balance of incentives and disincentives.\n\nOf course, should the positive trends we are presently witnessing not be confirmed in the future, and the Secretary-General report that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has backtracked on its closing of the Bosnian border, the draft resolution sponsored by the four member countries of the European Union and by the Czech Republic provides for the termination of the sanctions suspension.\n\nOn the other hand, should our optimism be rewarded, paragraph 7 of the draft resolution provides for the possibility of the Council's considering additional measures \"in the light of further progress in the situation\".\n\nWe hope that this possibility materializes as quickly as possible, in such a way as to allow the alleviation of sanctions with humanitarian implications. I am thinking, for instance, of the possibility of financial transactions for the purpose of supplying hospitals. Let us not forget that sanctions hurt people more than they do Governments. By creating the perception of an international conspiracy against the country, sanctions often tend to rally the people around the Government rather than mobilize them against it. If sanctions are to maintain their usefulness as an instrument of international policy, they must be applied cautiously.\nWe favour the extension of resolution 943 (1994), to eventually be followed by provisions to benefit the people of Serbia and Montenegro rather than their Government.\nWhile such an approach would not ensure an immediate solution to the Bosnian crisis, it would certainly help create favourable conditions for relaunching the peace process.\n\nFinally, whatever progress has been made can be attributed at least in part to our cohesiveness. If our house is divided against itself, we will only perpetuate that division among the very people we are seeking to help.\nBy the same token, our unity of purpose and intent can only instil that spirit among the factions, and help remove the last obstacle from the path to a fair, balanced and global political solution to the Bosnian crisis.\n\n","year":1995,"speech_no":16,"meeting_no":3487,"speaker":"Mr. Martino","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Italy)'","topic":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — Sanctions","conflict":"Yugoslavia","label":[[15,69,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[76,105,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[203,260,"Affect-satisfaction-positive"],[351,365,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[382,428,"Appreciation-complexity-negative"],[508,537,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[689,712,"Appreciation-valuation-negative"],[714,797,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[845,863,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[922,937,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1502,1519,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[1609,1643,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1646,1668,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[1702,1719,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[1735,1765,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1997,2020,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[2168,2220,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[2261,2280,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[2374,2418,"Judgement-tenacity-positive"],[2516,2538,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[3026,3046,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[3740,3747,"Affect-security-positive"],[4592,4613,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4668,4689,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[5097,5143,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"]]}
{"id":409,"text":"The Chinese delegation supports the draft resolution before us today. We hope that, upon adoption, it will play a positive role in the settlement of the question of Georgia.\nThe world is very much concerned about the long absence of a solution to the question of Georgia. The crux of a political settlement of the Georgian question is whether this newly independent Member State will continue to maintain its sovereignty and territorial integrity or will be dismembered. The position of the Security Council on this question is clear: the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia must be fully respected. A comprehensive political settlement of the Georgian question must proceed within this framework.\n\nThe Georgian Government, proceeding from the fundamental interests of the Georgian people, of all ethnic groups, has adopted a responsible attitude in promoting a comprehensive settlement of the Georgian question and has put forward constructive proposals, including that of establishing a federal State and granting Abkhazia wide-ranging autonomy. This position has provided a basis for an early settlement of the Georgian question, and we wish to express our appreciation and support for it.\n\nRegrettably, however, the Abkhaz authorities still cling to a rigid position and continue to set obstacles to a political settlement, which has brought the peace process to a standstill. We cannot but express our deep concern over this situation.\n\n  N0 country can be prosperous, with its people living in peace, without ethnic harmony and territorial integrity.\nTherefore, we urge the parties concerned, particularly the Abkhaz authorities, to adopt a realistic approach and take concrete action to focus on settling the political status of Abkhazia so as to advance the peace process in Georgia and enable the Georgian people, of all ethnic groups, to live and work in peace and contentment at an early date.\n\nThe Secretary-General and his Special Envoy have made tremendous efforts for a comprehensive political settlement of the Georgian question, for which we wish to express our support and our thanks. We also believe that the countries concerned in the region, particularly the Russian Federation, can play a unique mediating role, and indeed have already been doing so. The Council should therefore encourage them to continue and increase their efforts to that end.\n\nWe have noted that the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG)\nand the Commonwealth of Independent States enjoy good cooperation and are together playing a positive role in stabilizing the situation in the region and promoting the peace process in Georgia.

{"id":410,"text":"Let me express my gratitude to the members of the Security Council for 08-45458 this opportunity to address them. Today's special Council meeting is being held to consider the grave escalation of the situation in the Tskhinvali region of Georgia. First, I will reflect on the recent events that have led to that tragic deterioration.\n\nOn 1 August, at about 8 a.m. Tbilisi time, a pickup vehicle containing six Georgian police officers was hit by two remote-control explosive devices. As a result of that attack, five Georgian policemen were severely wounded. The central authorities decided not to retaliate, so as not to escalate the situation.\n\nOn 2 August, six civilians and one Georgian policeman were injured during the overnight shelling of seven Georgian villages in the South Ossetian conflict zone. The seven Georgian-controlled villages came under intense fire from South Ossetian separatists using large-calibre mortars. Georgian law-enforcement personnel fired back defensively for some time but then received a ceasefire order aimed at not escalating the situation.\n\nOn 3 August, the South Ossetian separatist government announced the evacuation of more than 500 people, including 400 children. However, the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia's Republic of North Ossetia told the Interfax news agency that it was not an evacuation; the children were being sent to North Ossetia as part of a prearranged summer camp programme, as he explained it. Russian media outlets started a massive propaganda campaign against Georgia.\n\nLate on 6 August, separatists opened fire with mortars on Georgian-populated villages: Eredvi and four others. Georgian Government forces fired back to defend the civilian population. As a result of intense crossfire during the night, two servicemen belonging to the Georgian battalion of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces were injured. The separatist regime also claimed several injuries on its side. Despite the targeted attacks on the peaceful population and villages, as well as on the Georgian police and peacekeeping forces, the central authorities decided not to respond with a heavy exchange of fire, in order not to injure the local population.\n\nTemur Yakobashvili, Georgian chief negotiator and State Minister for Reintegration, said in late-night televised remarks on 6 August that it was the position of the Georgian Government that only direct dialogue with the Tskhinvali authorities would resolve the 3 deteriorating security situation. Mr. Yakobashvili also stressed that Ambassador-at-Large Yuri Popov would attend the talks as a facilitator. South Ossetian chief negotiator Boris Chochiev refused to take part in the negotiations.\n\nOvernight and in the early-morning hours of 7August, intensive fire came from four positions in various Ossetian villages. The separatist authorities continued firing on Georgian law-enforcement personnel and peacekeeping units with mortars and artillery. The central authorities responded with limited fire in order to defend those positions.\n\nIn a morning interview with Russian news agencies, South Ossetian de facto President Eduard Kokoity declared that, if the Georgian Government did not withdraw its military forces from the region, he would start to clean them out. President Saakashvili, speaking with journalists at the military hospital in Gori, where he was visiting injured Georgian servicemen, said that, despite the attacks on the Georgian villages, Tbilisi was showing maximum restraint. The President also called on Russia to recall from South Ossetia its officials, who consider themselves the so-called South Ossetian government.\n\nOn the morning of 7 August, Temur Yakobashvili visited the conflict zone to meet with representatives of the separatist government. The Minister of State met with Marat Kulakhmetov, Commander of the Joint Peacekeeping Forces, in Tskhinvali. Once again, however, the separatists refused to negotiate with him.\nAnatoly Barankevich, head of the separatist republic's Security Council, threatened that armed groups of Cossacks from North Ossetia were headed towards South Ossetia to fight Georgian forces.\n\nBy 4 p.m. the same day, the separatists had resumed their shelling of Georgian villages. Three Georgian servicemen were injured when the South Ossetian separatist forces blew up an infantry combat vehicle belonging to the Georgian peacekeeping battalion. Georgian police responded by firing towards groups of armed separatists in those villages, killing two separatist militiamen and wounding two others.\nLater, the Georgian peacekeepers' checkpoint at Avnevi was bombed, and several Georgian servicemen and civilians were killed.\n\nIn a live televised address at 7.10 p.m., President Saakashvili said that he had ordered the Georgian forces to cease fire in South Ossetia. He stated that there had been casualties, including both deaths and injuries. Mr. Saakashvili said that he had ordered the ceasefire specifically to give the South Ossetian secessionist regime another opportunity to resume the talks. Despite Georgia's decision not to return fire, the Georgian village of Avnevi once again came under fire from South Ossetian militiamen at approximately 8.30 p.m. The village can be described as having been totally destroyed as a result of that attack.\n\nSouth Ossetian separatist armed groups fired at the Georgian-controlled village of Prisi at about 10.30 last night. The attack left several people wounded on the Georgian side. At approximately 11.30 p.m., the same separatist authorities opened fire on all Georgian positions around the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali, including those in the villages of Tamarasheni and Kurta. The police station in Kurta was totally destroyed as a result of that heavy fire.\n\nI want to state very clearly that the illegal separatist authorities and armed formations are under the control and direction of the security and defence agencies of the Russian Federation. Numerous high-ranking Russian officers from among the ranks of the peacekeepers, as well as other officials from the Russian military, intelligence, and law-enforcement services, are serving in senior roles in Tskhinvali.\n\nThat is a clear violation of Russia's obligation to remain neutral: instead, it has thus become a party to the conflict. These Russian officers and individuals include: Mr. Yuri Morozov, the Prime Minister, born in the Russian Federation, who, before his appointment in the government of South Ossetia in 2005, occupied various positions in Bashkiria; Mikhail Minzayev, Minister for Internal Affairs since 2005, a colonel in the Russian police, who, in 2004, during the counter-terrorist operation in Beslan, led FSB Special Unit Alpha; Anatoly Barankevich, Secretary of the National Security Council of South Ossetia since 2006 and a colonel in the Russian military forces, who participated in the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and in both Chechen wars; Boris Attoyev, Chairman since 2006 of the Committee for State Security, analogue of the KGB, who previously held various positions in the Soviet KGB and who after the completing his mission in Afghanistan was appointed to the central apparatus of the FSB in Moscow; Vasily Lunev, Minister for Defence of South Ossetia since March 2008, a general in the Russian army; Vladimir Kotoyev, head of the Government Protection Service since 2007, a colonel 08-45458 in the Russian army, who participated in the Chechen and Bosnian wars; and Oleg Chebotariev, head of the State Border Protection Services since 2005, a colonel in the Russian FSB. Those individuals were granted impunity by the Russian Federation from being held responsible for atrocities that they have been committing.\n\nThe Government's military action was taken in self-defence after repeated armed provocations and with the sole goal of protecting the civilian population and preventing further loss of life among residents of various ethnic backgrounds. We believe that every democratic State would have reacted in a similar fashion to protect its own citizens. The Government acted because the separatists not only defied the ceasefire but sharply escalated the violence, killing several peacekeepers and civilians within hours of the ceasefire.\n\nAdditional illegal forces and military equipment were and are entering Georgian territory from Russia through the Roki tunnel, threatening even worse violence. The separatists have also been continuing to threaten to attack other parts of the country outside the South Ossetian region, allegedly with the foreign assistance that is flowing into that region. Russian peacekeepers told Georgian officials that they were unable to control the separatists. The security situation was deteriorating and violence wais increasing rapidly.\nThe separatists were not heeding any appeal for direct talks.\n\nGeorgia seeks a negotiated solution to the conflict, with international engagement. Our offer of autonomy in line with European standards stands, with international guarantees including an elected regional parliament, an elected regional president, shared sovereignty and the protection of South Ossetian identity, culture and language, still on the table. Until such a solution is agreed, the region, we think, should be governed by the elected head of the South Ossetian administration, Dmitry Sanakoev, an ethnic Ossetian and former separatist leader.\n\nWe invite Russia to be constructively engaged in the economic rehabilitation of the region as well as to contribute to the agreed security arrangements there.\nThe Government's immediate goal at this point is to restore peace, to facilitate the return to normal life for all residents of the region and to allow the return of the refugees and internally displaced persons. We stand 08-45458 ready to ensure adequate supplies of water, electricity, food, emergency services, medical care and shelter.\nSeparatist rebels will be eligible for amnesty.\nHumanitarian organizations will have access to the region, and the Georgian Government has already allocated funding totalling €2 million for the immediate humanitarian and emergency needs of the region.\n\nAccording to verified reports, as we speak, a huge contingent of military personnel and equipment is illegally entering Georgia's sovereign territory through the Roki tunnel. The Russian Federation's Republic of North Ossetia has declared the mobilization of armed mercenaries to be sent to Georgia. There are disturbing signs that we are facing a calculated provocation for the purposes of escalating the situation in order to justify a pre-planned military intervention from the Russian side.\n\nWe therefore demand that the Russian Federation prevent the transit of armed mercenaries to Georgia, exercise its influence over the separatist regime to stop attacks on the civilian population and start negotiations.\n\nAs in my last address to this forum, I want to reiterate Georgia's call to the international community to explicitly condemn the continuing infringements of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity by the Russian Federation. Despite this most recent escalation, I want to emphasize that the Georgian Government once again calls for, and is showing its readiness to immediately begin, peace talks aimed at resolving the conflict in South Ossetia and calls on the separatist rebels to cease their military actions and come to the negotiating table.\n\n","year":2008,"speech_no":4,"meeting_no":5951,"speaker":"Mr. Alasania","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Georgia)'","topic":"Georgia","conflict":"Georia","label":[[0,27,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[176,192,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[312,332,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1208,1340,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[1456,1531,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[3897,3908,"Affect-inclination-negative"],[5761,5950,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[6174,6240,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[7812,7945,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[9392,9437,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[10444,10616,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[10640,10728,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[10976,11013,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"]]}
{"id":411,"text":"Just over two years ago, the Georgian Government and the Abkhaz leadership agreed to a cease-fire and appealed to the international community to help them to work for a political settlement. This Council responded by increasing, in both size and scope, the United Nations military observer presence on the ground in Georgia. It also made clear to the parties at that time that it expected them both to work urgently towards a comprehensive political settlement, and that such a settlement would have to respect fully the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognized borders.\n\nSince then, the Georgian Government has worked patiently and consistently towards that goal; the Abkhaz leadership has not. The Abkhaz leadership has failed to engage constructively in talks, in spite of Georgian proposals that would entail the widest possible autonomy for the Abkhaz region. It has blocked any significant return of non-Abkhaz refugees. And it has refused to face up to the fact that no country is prepared to contemplate an independent State of Abkhazia. In doing this, the Abkhaz leadership has condemned its own people to an impoverished and uncertain existence.\n\nThis Council will shortly extend the current mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) for a further six months. That decision represents the willingness of Council members to continue to commit scarce United Nations resources in the hope the current stalemate in negotiations can be overcome. It also represents the willingness of countries to make military personnel available. As a member of the Friends of the Secretary-General for Georgia, and as a leading contributor of personnel to UN OMIG, we are grateful to the Special Envoy, his Head of Mission and the Chief Military Observer, as well as to the members of UNOMIG, for their work. But UNOMIG must be able to count on the support of the parties, which requested United Nations involvement on the ground. The recent increase in the laying of mines in UNOMIG's area of responsibility is of particular concern, and we look to the parties to do all they can to ensure that such activities cease. We welcome the Secretariat's efforts to redeploy mine-protected vehicles and to provide UNOMIG with a mine detection and clearance capability, and we urge those concerned to work with the Secretariat so that such measures can be implemented as soon as possible. The objective is to work towards the restoration of UNOMIG' s operational effectiveness. The presence of the peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is an important factor in achieving this, and we hope that UN OMIG and the CIS peace-keeping force will continue to develop closer cooperation to this end.\nIn addition, reconstruction and respect for human rights are key elements in developing stability and allowing the return of normality to the region. In particular, we welcome proposals to implement a programme for the protection and promotion of human rights, and look forward to the Secretary-General's report on arrangements to establish a human rights office in Sukhumi.\n\nWe believe that UNOMIG continues to have a valuable role in sustaining the conditions necessary to allow a lasting settlement to emerge. But - and we always say this on these occasions - it is up to the parties, and in particular the Abkhaz leadership, to demonstrate that they are prepared to work earnestly and constructively towards a settlement. The British Government continues to believe that any such settlement, if it is to be viable, must fully respect Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders.\n\n  ","year":1996,"speech_no":9,"meeting_no":3680,"speaker":"Sir John Weston","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"United Kingdom)'","topic":"Georgia","conflict":"Georia","label":[[426,460,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[618,691,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[711,740,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[1164,1200,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1727,1743,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[2181,2217,"Affect-satisfaction-positive"],[2665,2674,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[2941,2951,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[3152,3208,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[3445,3479,"Appreciation-balance-positive"]]}
{"id":412,"text":"Unfortunately, I must note that the statement by the Permanent Representative of Georgia at this evening's meeting included many distortions and contradictions. On the one hand, the representative of Georgia said that the Russian Federation is controlling everything in South Ossetia, but at the same time, he alleged that the Russian military say that they are incapable of controlling the separatists. If Russia has aggressive intentions, as the representative of Georgia alleged today, then why has the Georgian side, over a long period of time, refused to reach an agreement on the non-use of force in the Georgian-South Ossetian and Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, which would protect Georgia against any attempt to use force by anyone at all. From listening to the Permanent Representative of Georgia, it might appear that South Ossetian forces are attacking Tbilisi; in fact, as we all know, the situation is quite the contrary.\n\nI would like also to comment on the point that during Security Council's prior consultations today, the Council was unable to work out a clear reaction to today's events and was unable to send an unambiguous message to both parties, primarily Tbilisi, on the need to put an end to violence and on the need to reject the use of force. The reason for the incapacity of the Security Council to develop a clear reaction to these events unfortunately lies in the absence of clear political guidelines among a number of Council members. This has been demonstrated again during this evening's discussion in our open meeting.\n\nLet me comment on another specific point. In fact, I spoke of this in my statement today and it was also heard in the statement by the representative of the United States: that in recent days Moscow and Washington have very much been in contact. It seemed to us that there was a certain mutual understanding with our United States colleagues about the need to take steps which could put an end to the escalation of the conflict. But in her statement today in the Security Council the representative of the United States only once used the word \"condemn\" - and that was against South Ossetia, for its alleged failure to attend one of the proposed meetings. And yet, they failed to find clear political terms to describe the aggressive actions of Tbilisi and of the Georgian armed forces attempting to invade Tskhinvali.\n\nIt is precisely this inconsistency and this vagueness in the political position that are among the main reasons for the critical situation regarding the South Ossetian-Georgian conflict.\n\nNevertheless, I hope that today's meeting of the Security Council has been useful and that it will be seen by Tbilisi as indicating that the Security Council, one of the leading institutions of the international community, is not prepared to accept the attempts to resolve the long-standing Georgian-South Ossetian conflict through armed aggression.\n\n","year":2008,"speech_no":15,"meeting_no":5951,"speaker":"Mr. Churkin","gender":"M","language":"Russian","country":"Russian Federation","topic":"Georgia","conflict":"Georia","label":[[0,13,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[32,159,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[1034,1149,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[1283,1321,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[1798,1860,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[2059,2107,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2218,2259,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2393,2452,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[2575,2581,"Affect-inclination-positive"]]}
{"id":414,"text":"It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of January. We are confident that under your able guidance the Council will successfully carry out its responsibilities.\n\nI should like also to pay tribute to Ambassador Bakuramutsa of Rwanda for his able work as President of the Council last month.\n\nIt is also a great pleasure to welcome the Foreign Minister of Italy, a friendly and allied country.\n\nOn numerous occasions we have expressed before this Council our views on the ongoing tragedy in Bosnia. I do not intend to repeat them. Today, I should like to confine my statement to our hope that the agreement on the complete cessation of hostilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina will not remain simply an agreement on paper, but will become a first step towards the achievement of a just and viable peace. To that end, this agreement should not be allowed to lead in any way to a freezing of the situation on the ground. Such a freezing could seriously undermine the chances of a just and viable peace. Therefore, we believe it is high time for credible pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to make them accept the peace plan unconditionally. Such pressure should be exerted without further delay.\n\nUnfortunately, there are reports that Serbian aggression is continuing in and around the Bihac region. The so-called Abdic forces and the Croatian Serbs should not be allowed to violate this agreement and the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Croatian Serbs'\ninvolvement in the aggression is a clear sign of defiance of the relevant Security Council resolutions. Resolutions 824 (1993) and 836 (1993) clearly define the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) vis-a-vis the safe areas. UNPROFOR is committed to defend the safe areas. The full implementation of this mandate is still a very urgent and vital need. In this context, we welcome the proposal of the Force Commander pertaining to the strengthening of UNPROFOR with a view to enabling it to contribute better to the implementation of the agreement on the complete cessation of hostilities. The reinforcement of UNPROFOR should be completed as soon as possible.\n\nWe have serious reservations about the draft resolution. The monitoring mechanism established under resolution 943 (1994) is not effective. There are still only about 200 monitors in the Mission. Because of this shortage of manpower for the monitoring of a long border, the effectiveness and credibility of the monitors are widely questioned.\n\nOn the other hand, it is true that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) could play an important role in convincing Karadzic forces to accept the peace plan. The adoption of resolution 943 (1994) was based on the optimistic assumption that if Serbia and Montenegro had been encouraged it could have played an instrumental role to this end. However, a hundred days elapsed and the Serbs continued their defiance of the will of international community. The peace plan has still to be accepted by the Bosnian Serbs.\n\nDuring this period we have also witnessed a new round of aggression against the safe area of Bihac, in which the Croatian Serbs were also involved.\n\nDespite Serbia and Montenegro's claim that it has closed its borders with the Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and despite the certification provided by the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY) Mission monitoring the border, many independent international sources acknowledge that the border continues to be violated through the transport of strategic material and personnel. It is extremely important that the monitoring mechanisms be strengthened and the number of monitors increased. In addition, serious consideration should be given to independent third-party sources.\n\nFurthermore, having examined the report of the Co-Chairmen of the ICFY Steering Committee, we have once again learned that the border monitoring Mission, under the direction of the Co-Chairmen, has approved   fuel shipments to the so-called Croatian Serbs. This is a clear violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia, as well as of resolution 820 (1993). It was these fuel shipments that enabled Croatian Serbs to continue their aggression against the safe area of Bihac. Therefore, we hope that the adoption of this draft resolution will at least contribute to the termination of these shipments. We also look forward to the strengthening of mechanisms for deterring and reporting violations.\n\nIn conclusion, I once again strongly urge the Serbian side to accept the peace plan unconditionally.\n\n","year":1995,"speech_no":6,"meeting_no":3487,"speaker":"Mr. Batu","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Turkey)'","topic":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — Sanctions","conflict":"Yugoslavia","label":[[0,46,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[172,186,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[204,216,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[269,283,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[328,337,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[390,417,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[449,478,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[558,573,"Affect-security-negative"],[862,885,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[900,986,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1061,1082,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1106,1121,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[1126,1143,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1217,1270,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[1273,1286,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[1380,1425,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[1656,1709,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[1894,1923,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[1945,1952,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[2048,2080,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[2234,2262,"Affect-security-negative"],[2291,2372,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2504,2575,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[2617,2755,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[2812,2833,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3668,3694,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[3792,3829,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[4097,4122,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[4124,4149,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[4431,4438,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4546,4587,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4657,4684,"Judgement-propriety-positive"]]}
{"id":415,"text":"\nAllow me, Sir, to congratulate you on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for this month and to assure you that my delegation is fully committed to assisting you on the many important issues that will come before the   Council, particularly those that concern Croatia and its neighbours.\n\nI also extend my delegation's compliments to the Permanent Representative of Rwanda for the able way in which he led the work of the Council during December.\n\nMy delegation would also like to take this opportunity to welcome the Foreign Minister of Italy, His Excellency Mr. Antonio Martino, who is a high-ranking representative of a friendly neighbouring State.\n\nCroatia welcomes the draft resolution before the Council. It contains elements that will be of great benefit to the peace process in Croatia and the region in general. It also contains elements that should enhance the credibility of the Council, following the reports and decisions regarding the illicit transfer of fuel into the occupied territories of Croatia from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). This draft resolution alleviates some of our concern that the international community may not be sufficiently determined in its quest for a durable peace in the region.\n\nParagraph 3 of the draft resolution extends the Yugoslav-Bosnian border blockade to affect Croatia. From now on Belgrade will not be able to send non-humanitarian assistance to the occupied territories of Croatia via the Bosnia and Herzegovina border, without consequences.\nShould the Belgrade authorities choose to violate paragraph 12 of resolution 820 (1993) in this way, the Council will be left with no alternative but to reinstate the sanctions that were suspended by its resolution 943 (1994).\n\nThe Council's decision in this regard is made with the same principles in mind as when paragraph 12 was included in resolution 820 (1993) in the first place - to reiterate Croatia's sovereignty over its entire territory; to promote economic reintegration between the Government and the local Serb authorities in the United Nations protected areas in Croatia; and to protect the Croatian citizens in the protected areas from the sanctions regime imposed on the occupier, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). Indeed, the reinforcement of this paragraph represents the Council's commitment to the spirit and the letter of that resolution.\nThe Council's decision is especially welcome at a time when my Government is pursuing implementation of the economic reintegration agreement of 2 December with the same local Serb authorities.\n\nThis extension of the border blockade, however, is not complete. The border between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Croatia's United Nations protected areas Sector East can still be used by Belgrade without consequences. The members of the Council should bear this in mind with regard to the next review of the issue, which will take place in a hundred days' time. This may be quite possible, as substantial human and financial resources will be released from Croatia at about that time, given my Government's decision today on the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The UNPROFOR resources would thus be usable for other alternatives. A complete blockade of the border between Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia in this way would further the peace process in Croatia.\n\nMy Government's decision on the UNPROFOR mandate, which was transmitted to the Secretary-General this morning and to your office, Mr. President, this afternoon, was taken with full regard for the international community's concerns and interests in the region. On this occasion I shall simply emphasize the words of my President - that the Security Council can continue to count, in full confidence, on Croatia's acting in a manner consistent with its long-standing constructive policy in the region.\n\nCroatia will continue to support the work of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia and to look for a political solution consistent with Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, in a reasonable time-frame. We shall continue to negotiate the 2-4 political plan for Croatia with the Contact Group. We shall continue to work to implement the economic agreement of 2 December, with the assistance of the international community. But we shall not allow the annexation of any part of our sovereign territory.\n\nWe hope that the international community will be able, in the coming months, to seize the opportunity to assist Croatia to reintegrate its occupied territories in a timely and peaceful way. The draft resolution gives us great hope. I should like to take this opportunity to praise the sponsors of the draft resolution for their serious and skilful work.\n\nA viable Croatia will as such also be able to play a more significant role in achieving the desired balance of power in the region - a balance that is still needed because of one party's rejection of the Contact Group plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina. A political solution for   Bosnia and Herzegovina does not appear likely in the near future. By addressing the situation in Croatia first, however, the international community can help Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the short term, by reallocating the necessary additional UNPROFOR resources into Bosnia and Herzegovina, and, in the long term, by creating conditions of balance favourable to continuing with the Contact Group plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina. This draft resolution is a small but important step in that direction.\n\n","year":1995,"speech_no":4,"meeting_no":3487,"speaker":"Mr. Nobilo","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Croatia)'","topic":"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) — Sanctions","conflict":"Yugoslavia","label":[[19,31,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[319,353,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[400,412,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[529,536,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[645,654,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[684,692,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[768,784,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[1108,1155,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[1165,1223,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1547,1606,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1652,1723,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[2230,2303,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2471,2478,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[3055,3096,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[3870,3935,"Judgement-tenacity-positive"],[4155,4181,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[4481,4488,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4641,4669,"Judgement-propriety-positive"],[4701,4711,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[4712,4774,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4809,4833,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4838,4852,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4887,4910,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[5439,5460,"Appreciation-balance-positive"],[5567,5593,"Appreciation-impact-positive"]]}

A year ago, the Ukrainian people took the downing of Flight MH-17 as a national tragedy, and it will always remain so in our hearts. 1 still remember the sea of flowers in front of the Dutch and Malaysian embassies, and the hundreds of Ukrainians who gathered around those buildings during the night.\nI will never forget it.\n\nWhen we heard about this incident, at the very beginning we had some hope that lives might be saved and immediately provided all available resources to the rescue teams. Then we did everything possible to prevent looting and to secure access for the investigators to the areas controlled by the terrorists. Now, our duty to those who died and the families of the victims is to bring to justice those who committed this barbaric act.\nWe, more than anyone, feel the pain of the victims; that is why we want the truth about this crime to emerge.\nMore than anyone, we want the perpetrators to be arraigned and tried by a public international court.\nThere can be no reason to oppose that, unless you are a perpetrator yourself.\n\nI could not agree more with my friends and colleagues, including several Government ministers who have spoken today, but I would like to make several points crystal clear. Resolution 2166 (2014) established an obligation for States to cooperate fully in the course of the investigation of this tragedy and to bring those responsible to justice. The use of a sophisticated and powerful weapon against a civilian aircraft constitutes a threat to international civil aviation and to international peace and security in general. The only effective way to prevent such acts in the future is to punish those responsible without delay. It is indeed an issue for the Security Council to deal with under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\n\nThe level of support enjoyed by our draft resolution has clearly risen, showing that we are on right track.\nOur aim here is to create an effective, transparent, unbiased and independent vehicle to bring to justice those responsible for the crime. It is about the individual criminal responsibility of the murderers, and it is not about politics. That is why it is particularly disappointing that one country - Russia, to be precise - still mixes two completely separate issues: its responsibility for aggression against Ukraine and its continuous support for terrorism, on the one hand, and the individual responsibility of the perpetrators of the tragedy, on the other. There is no other explanation for today's veto by Russia.\n\nThe role of Russia in the conflict is absolutely clear and well known. Thousands of Russian soldiers and mercenaries and tanks and every type of heavy weaponry have been delivered across the border; that is simply impossible to hide. Just recently, another Russian truck full of weapons and ammunition was captured in Ukraine. The driver is once again a Special Forces officer. But this story is a matter for international mechanisms.\n\nWhen I look at the Russian delegation today, I feel pity. It dared to dampen the aspirations of the entire world, especially those of the families of the victims.\nIt has aligned itself with the thugs who committed this atrocious crime. But our hope for justice is not lost.\nThe Russian Federation just killed draft resolution S\/2015\/562, but that abuse of the veto power will not kill the hope of those who suffered or their love for loved ones and their relatives. It will only make all ofus stronger and more determined and more committed to elaborating and implementing an effective and credible prosecution model to deliver justice.\n\nI am reminded of a line from Shakespeare about captive good attending captain ill; let us stop attending captain ill - it is just not worth it. In the face of truth, humanity and God, if one still believes in God, the tribunal in question is about 298 innocent lives. It is about the truth. He who is afraid of truth is definitely on the wrong side of the issue. He who is afraid of truth is alone here in the Security Council. \"If you know the truth, the truth will set you free.\" These are not my words. They are from the Holy Gospel. They come from a higher authority.\n\n","year":2015,"speech_no":22,"meeting_no":7498,"speaker":"Mr. Klimkin","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Ukraine)'","topic":"Letter dated 28 February 2014 from the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (S\/2014\/136)","conflict":"Ukraine","label":[[265,277,"Affect-satisfaction-positive"],[397,465,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[850,896,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[1153,1229,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[1275,1310,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[1443,1465,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[1525,1541,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[1643,1669,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[1886,1899,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1905,1921,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[1923,1951,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[1965,2009,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[2011,2027,"Appreciation-balance-positive"],[2113,2190,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2192,2214,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[2349,2362,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[2427,2442,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[3023,3044,"Judgement-capacity-positive"],[3072,3131,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[3152,3183,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3185,3282,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[3296,3328,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[3334,3607,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[3706,3737,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[4148,4160,"Affect-inclination-negative"],[4162,4216,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[4267,4338,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[4348,4376,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[4451,4474,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[4597,4644,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4680,4720,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[4825,4858,"Affect-inclination-negative"],[4861,4884,"Appreciation-valuation-negative"],[5032,5103,"Judgement-veracity-negative"],[5105,5168,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[5294,5312,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"]]}
{"id":463,"text":"Let me also begin by thanking you, Mr. President, for convening this important meeting to consider a serious development that comes to all of us as a shock.\n\nWe all saw the pain-ridden face of that small child lying at his father's side as the last breath of life slipped out of him. This was only one glimpse of the fate that is suffered by thousands of children in different parts of the world that are under foreign occupation or in conflict situations. This tragedy is a grim reminder that a part of humanity dies each time an innocent life is snuffed out by violence.\n\nThe Security Council meets today in the wake of the tragic events in Palestine, resulting in the deaths of scores of innocent civilians, including children, and injuries to many others. With these events, the hope that peace was finally taking root in the Middle East has fast evaporated.\n\nWe share the international outrage and concern at the high-handedness of the Israeli forces' actions against defenceless Palestinian civilians in the very vicinity of Al-Haram Al-Sharif, the third most holy place of Islam. The immediate reason is the misplaced determination of certain elements in Israel to undermine the Middle East peace process. The Security Council must send an unequivocal message that such provocative actions and the bloodshed of innocent Palestinians are unacceptable to the international community.\n\nThe excessive force used by the Israeli security forces is simply unjustifiable. Grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949 have been committed. The first article of that Convention emphasizes that \"The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances.\" Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) continue to provide a viable and just framework for a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The status of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, Holy Jerusalem, remains central to any comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict. No lasting peace in the region will be possible without the realization of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. These include their right to establish their independent State with Holy Jerusalem as its capital and the exercise of their full sovereignty over Al-Haram Al-Sharif. Pakistan extends its unequivocal support to the just struggle of the people of Palestine for their inalienable rights. This has been our policy in respect of all peoples struggling against foreign occupation and repression.\n\nThe peace process had recently been making steady, if agonizingly slow, progress due to realistic approaches of the leaders of the two sides. It has now been dealt a severe blow and has been pushed to the verge of collapse. Continuation of the violence threatens to wreck the peace process. Immediate steps are therefore needed to prevent any further deterioration of the situation. The peace process must be urgently put back on track on the basis of agreements reached and full compliance with the relevant Security Council resolutions. At stake are the authority and credibility of the United Nations.\n\nPrompt action is therefore required by the international community, in particular the Security Council, to put an end to the present round of violence against the Palestinians, secure Israel's compliance with United Nations resolutions, ensure the safety and sanctity of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and facilitate the realization of the national rights of the Palestinian people. The prospects for peace in that region, and indeed the future prosperity of the Middle East, now rest with this body.\n\n","year":2000,"speech_no":4,"meeting_no":4204,"speaker":"Mr. Ahmad","gender":"M","language":"English","country":"Pakistan)'","topic":"Middle East situation, including the Palestinian question","conflict":"Palestine","label":[[0,33,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[69,86,"Appreciation-valuation-positive"],[101,120,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[284,363,"Appreciation-complexity-negative"],[457,489,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[779,862,"Affect-security-negative"],[864,910,"Affect-security-negative"],[1213,1266,"Judgement-normality-positive"],[1390,1414,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1808,1835,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[2298,2339,"Affect-inclination-positive"],[2814,2830,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[3130,3143,"Appreciation-quality-positive"]]}
{"id":487,"text":"I shall be very brief.\n\nToday's meeting was a very emotional one, which is understandable. At times it gave rise to the question: are there any limits to the political exploitation of the feelings of the families of those who perished and who are experiencing a living horror? A number of accusations were levelled at the Russian Federation that I consider insulting and not worthy of diplomats.\n\nTurning now to the substance of the issues, we made our arguments in our statement. I will touch on only one issue, on the outcome of the discussions. It is simply incomprehensible that a lack of understanding of one form of judicial proceedings is being equated with impunity. We made, and reaffirm, a proposal to consider various formats for judicial proceedings.\nAmong them are simpler ones that are more effective, more appropriate and certainly less politicized; these are the ones on which we should focus.\n\nIn his statement, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ukraine, Mr. Klimkin, attempted to speak from a moral and religious position of superiority. He referred to the unacceptability of impunity and the need to cooperate. I have only two questions for him: why were civilian airliners sent to areas where military activities were under way, areas where the Ukrainian forces were fighting using military aircraft? Why were civilian flights sent through that airspace? The passengers on that airliner simply could not have known that a military conflict was under way there. Even Malaysian aviation authorities could not have known that a military conflict was under way there. But Kyiv knew it. Why did it do this? Why has it thus far not provided the recordings of its military air dispatchers? That is impunity. Did they punish anyone in Ukraine for that? Finally, the tragedy concerning Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 is a terrible event - not only for the citizens who died in that castrophe and the countries that they represented, but also for the diplomats who now are forced to deal with it. It is also a trial for the concerned politicians, experts and specialists who continue to work on this issue together. We need to walk hand-in-hand down on this road. Unfortunately, today's meeting is most unlikely to promote joint movement towards the final objective, that is, to shed light on all of the circumstances surrounding this tragedy and to bring those responsible for it to justice. Russia is ready to resume this work at expert, diplomatic and any other levels. Let us therefore move forward from tomorrow-on in this effort.\n\n","year":2015,"speech_no":40,"meeting_no":7498,"speaker":"Mr. Churkin","gender":"M","language":"Russian","country":"Russian Federation","topic":"Letter dated 28 February 2014 from the Permanent Representative of Ukraine to the United Nations addressed to the President of the Security Council (S\/2014\/136)","conflict":"Ukraine","label":[[11,21,"Appreciation-balance-positive"],[44,64,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[260,275,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[345,394,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[554,577,"Affect-happiness--negative"],[800,863,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[865,908,"Judgement-propriety-positive"],[987,1056,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[1167,1322,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[1377,1481,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[1833,1849,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[2405,2483,"Judgement-capacity-positive"]]}
{"id":496,"text":"The extremely grave situation prevailing in the occupied Palestinian territories has already had such serious negative implications for the entire Middle East region that it has become a cause of great concern for all countries and peoples of the world. One of the threats arising today is Israel's ongoing construction of a huge racist wall, designed, inter alia, to seize large tracts of Palestinian land and annex them to the Zionist entity; to lay siege to the Palestinian people, increase their isolation and cut them off from their natural physical environment; and to turn Palestinian territory into isolated pieces of land subject to oversight and control by the colonial military settlements, which continue their creeping expansion, undermining the territorial integrity of the would-be Palestinian State and preventing the population of the territories from travelling to their capital in East Jerusalem and gaining access to their holy places of worship.\n\nThe construction of this wall falls within a larger scheme that is plain to see. The scheme is now being implemented in graphic detail in the Gaza Strip, one of the most densely populated regions in the world, which Israel is tearing apart by force into four segments, with a View to attaining the political and economic subjection of the Palestinian population to Israeli control and to severing its only outlet to the world: the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nWhat is called a wall is in fact an integrated system of large projects, including highways, bypass roads, observation towers, electronically operated bunkers for automatic weapons, lighting systems on both sides of the wall and military barracks. The wall is three times that of the Berlin wall. Construction costs are so astronomically high that the Israeli State has been unable to finance the wall on its own and thus has had to make use of foreign credit guarantees.\n\nThe expansionist policy pursued by Israel since its creation in 1948 and practised for more than half a century has created a huge humanitarian crisis for the Palestinian people. That has resulted in the displacement of some 4 million Palestinians, who have been uprooted by Israel from their land and turned into refugees. Among that population, an entire generation knows almost nothing beyond life in refugee camps in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and several other countries and whose members are prevented by Israel from returning to their homes.\n\nIsrael has continued to build colonial settlements in the Palestinian and other Arab territories occupied by it since 1967, despite United Nations opposition to the Israeli settlement policy, which is in open defiance of the will of the international community and the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, which consider the construction of Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories to be a violation of the norms of international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\n\nThe construction of this wall is the culmination of a security scheme covering all settlements illegally built by Israel on the occupied Palestinian territories since 1967 and consolidating those settlements as a prelude to devouring the territories and annexing them to the Zionist entity.\n\nThe Israeli representative said this morning before the Council that after his country withdrew from southern Lebanon in May 2000 it had built a wall similar to that now under construction in the occupied Palestinian territories and that Israel had moved part of that wall 95 centimetres, at the cost of millions of dollars, in deference to the Secretary-General's wishes.\n\nIf those words are true, and if that is Israel's logic, then the question that arises today is: why has Israel not withdrawn in response to the calls by the international community and world public opinion?\nWhy does Israel not respond to the call by the Secretary-General and the international community to stop the construction of the wall on Palestinian territory? Those calls have been made for more than two years now. Why has Israel waited for 22 years -and waged three wars and hundreds of air raids until it was forced to withdraw from southern Lebanon - to build this wall? That withdrawal took place because we upheld our rights and because the international community also upheld those rights. Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon came under pressure from the resistance in southern Lebanon. Despite Israel's construction of the wall, Israel continues to occupy the Shab'a farms. The construction of the wall along the Blue Line did not prevent Israel from committing acts of aggression against Lebanon and waging air raids and other deliberate strikes against Lebanese territory.\n\nThe Palestinian people endure nothing but tragedy as a result of this overt plunder of its territories and assets and of the standard accusation against the Palestinians of being terrorists. Palestinians are pressured and executed because they demand their legitimate rights not to have their homeland torn apart and to prevent the pillaging of their natural resources by Israeli settlers under the protection of the Israeli occupation army.\n\nThe continuation, by Israel, of the construction of the wall will isolate Israel itself from the whole world and from its natural physical environment -politically, humanely and economically. The near future will prove that Israel, instead of forcing the Palestinian people to live in isolation, is actually creating a much greater isolation for itself, an isolation in a ghetto similar to those horrendous ones known in European history. The Government of Israel will thus destroy all prospects for the revival of the peace process, especially the peace offered in the Arab peace initiative, adopted at the Beirut summit in 2002.\n\nIf the Government of Israel continues to brush aside the advice offered by the friends of peace and the international community, and persists in the construction of the wall, that construction will be yet another testimony to the continued injustices committed by the Government of Israel against the Palestinian people and proof of the selfishness and inhumane attitude of the Israeli people.\n\nLebanon, which has been directly affected by the displacement of the Palestinian people since 1948 and continues to live side by side with this valiant people and to resist this tragedy, does not accept that these people continue to live in isolation as prisoners of the occupation within a new, large Israeli prison.\n\nTherefore Lebanon appeals to the Security Council to adopt the draft resolution, submitted by the Arab group, which considers the construction by Israel, the occupying Power, of this wall in the occupied Palestinian territories as a violation of the 1949 armistice line. The draft resolution also states that this construction is illegal on the basis of international law and requires the end of construction on the wall, the demolition of those portions that have already been built and the restoration of the status quo ante.\n\nUntil the establishment of a comprehensive and just peace leading to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian State that would include all national Palestinian territory - according to the 4 June 1967 borders - with Jerusalem as the capital, we hope that the Council's resolutions will uphold the status of the United Nations and its central role in bringing about justice and building peace.\n\n","year":2003,"speech_no":65,"meeting_no":4841,"speaker":"Mr. Kronfol","gender":"M","language":"Arabic","country":"Lebanon","topic":"Middle East situation, including the Palestinian question","conflict":"Palestine","label":[[3,30,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[48,80,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[97,131,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[196,209,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[671,700,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[708,741,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[968,1047,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1184,1216,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1424,1495,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[1747,1766,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[1897,1957,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2023,2047,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[2146,2219,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2410,2471,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2474,2585,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2876,2901,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[2909,2953,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3049,3117,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3124,3157,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[4250,4365,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[4760,4810,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[5016,5034,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[5355,5393,"Appreciation-complexity-negative"],[5873,5962,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[6168,6227,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[6374,6388,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[6481,6546,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[6702,6722,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[7105,7135,"Appreciation-complexity-positive"],[7323,7331,"Affect-inclination-positive"]]}
{"id":497,"text":"At the outset, I extend my congratulations to you, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the Security Council for the month of October. We also express our appreciation to your predecessor, the Permanent Representative of Mali. In addition, we would like to express our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for your serious consideration of the item on the Council's agenda today, which represents your first task since assuming the presidency, and to express our thanks to the members of the Council, in particular the members of the Non-Aligned Movement on the Council.\n\nOn 28 September 2000, Mr. Ariel Sharon, whose record is well known, took a provocative and insulting step against Arabs and Muslims when he visited Al-Haram Al-Sharif in occupied East Jerusalem with the purpose of bolstering Israel's illegitimate claims to control the third holiest site in Islam. Mr. Sharon was accompanied during his visit by a huge number of Israeli security forces, something that led to an escalation of tensions and a sense of confrontation.\nThis resulted in clashes at the site of Al-Haram Al-Sharif and throughout occupied East Jerusalem.\nThose clashes took place between Palestinian citizens protesting Sharon's visit and Israeli security forces, and caused injuries to vast numbers of Palestinian civilians.\n\nOn 29 September 2000, after Muslim Friday prayers had been held at noon, large numbers of Israeli security forces assaulted Al-Haram Al-Sharif and attacked Muslim worshippers, thereby committing a gross act of aggression against that holy place. These events recall a similar act of aggression committed by Israeli security forces against Al-Haram Al-Sharif on 8 October 1990, when those forces killed 20 Palestinians and injured 150 Muslim worshipers.\nThe Sharon visit and the forced entry into Al-Haram Al-Sharif by Israeli security forces resulted in a large number of injuries and touched off massive protests by Palestinian civilians in occupied East Jerusalem and across the occupied Palestinian territories. Those protests stemmed from our people's conviction of the need to defend its holy sites against Israeli aggression and from deep frustration at the Israeli Government's policies and attitudes, which have impeded any meaningful progress in the peace process that would lead to a change in the status quo, despite the genuine efforts made by many parties, including the American Administration and the American President himself.\n\nIt was surprising, therefore, that Israel, the occupying Power, reacted to the protests by Palestinian civilians as if what it had done earlier was not sufficient in itself. Israeli security forces used considerable military power, including snipers, live ammunition, hand grenades and anti-tank missiles.\nLater, helicopter gunships and moving tanks were brought into the vicinity of Palestinian towns and manned Palestinian police force posts.\n\nIsraeli soldiers deliberately killed a number of Palestinian civilians, including a Palestinian child, Mohammed Al-Durra, whose story is now well-known.\nThe Israeli security forces also caused severe pain and suffering to, and inflicted serious injuries on, many other civilians. Later, on 1 and 2 October, and to a lesser extent on 30 September, certain members of the Palestinian police force, having seen firsthand the severity and brutality of the attacks mounted by the Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians, engaged in clashes with those forces, including Israeli Army troops, using personal weapons, which resulted in the death of an additional number of police officers.\n\nThat exchange of fire does not change the basic nature of the events in question, which are in essence acts of oppression and brutality by Israeli security forces against Palestinian civilians. That campaign of aggression resulted in 42 martyrs, including a number of children under the age of 16, and injured more than 1,200 people, many of whom are in serious condition.\nThis appalling four-day toll, which does not include today's casualties, proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the Israeli security forces deliberately tried to inflict the greatest possible harm on the Palestinian people, using their military machinery in an unprecedented fashion.\n\nThe actions carried out by the occupying Israeli forces over the past few days constitute a grave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War of 1949. We believe that certain members of the Israeli Army are guilty of war crimes and must be brought to justice.\nThis is, of course, in addition to the destructive impact of these actions on the peace agreements in place and on the peace process.\n\nBut other serious events took place inside Israel itself, not just in the Palestinian occupied territories.\nSome Israeli Arabs staged demonstrations and protests in solidarity with their brethren in the Palestinian territories. In response, the Israeli Government and police force took brutal action against this segment of its population, resulting in the death of 10 citizens and hundreds of injuries. We are talking about Israel itself here, not the occupied territories. We are talking about the Israeli Government, not the occupying Power. We are talking about Israeli citizens, albeit of Arab origin, not Palestinian citizens. This is yet more proof that Israel bears tremendous responsibility for the bloodshed of the past few days.\n\nSome in Israel have tried to shift the blame onto the Palestinian side, claiming that the Palestinian Authority provoked its citizens. Only a gullible person or a racist would make such an allegation - a person blind to the manifestations of occupation, the continued suffering of the Palestinian people and the failure of the peace process to bring about genuine change in the daily lives of the Palestinian people. Such a person would have to be incapable of discerning the sense of frustration and humiliation gripping our people because of Israeli policies, including the attempt to profane our holy sites. Only a racist person would believe that a Palestinian citizen is inferior to others and can be ordered to be killed. Only a racist person could not understand that the Palestinian people have their own dignity and rights, like all other peoples on the planet.\n\nWhat has happened over the past few days and the unprecedented actions of the Israeli side can be explained in one of only two ways. The first possibility is that Israel has decided to break the will of the Palestinian people and to undermine the credibility of the Palestinian leadership in order to force it to accept concessions within the framework of the peace process.\nThe other possibility is that some Israeli military officers have taken matters into their own hands for personal or political reasons. The truth might be a mixture of these two possibilities. However, we must get to the heart of the matter and understand the facts through an investigation of what happened. Those responsible must be brought to justice. We must ensure that there is no recurrence of these bloody events in the future.\n\nThe Security Council has a very specific responsibility. It must put an immediate end to Israel's brutal campaign and to the occupying Power's violation of international law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention and relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as of the commitments undertaken in the peace accords.\n\nThis is the immediate responsibility of the Council, in accordance with the United Nations Charter. If the Council were to succeed in fulfilling these obligations, as is our hope, it would indeed have played an extremely crucial role, not only in addressing the immediate grave situation as it is unfolding on the ground and in upholding international law, including international humanitarian law, but also in creating a necessary favourable environment to enable the peace process to be resuscitated and perhaps later to be resumed with a view to achieving a final agreement between the two sides. We sincerely hope that this will be achieved.\n\n","year":2000,"speech_no":2,"meeting_no":4204,"speaker":"Mr. Al-Kidwa","gender":"M","language":"Arabic","country":"Palestine","topic":"Middle East situation, including the Palestinian question","conflict":"Palestine","label":[[14,49,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[143,175,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[248,296,"Affect-happiness-positive"],[322,343,"Appreciation-quality-positive"],[619,645,"Judgement-tenacity-negative"],[653,684,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[813,832,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1405,1438,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1499,1535,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1573,1645,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[1912,1928,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[1992,2028,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2460,2477,"Affect-satisfaction-negative"],[2503,2523,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[2642,2690,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3071,3124,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[3324,3365,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[3696,3728,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[3966,3994,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[4138,4164,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[4343,4360,"Judgement-normality-negative"],[4605,4623,"Appreciation-impact-negative"],[4954,5000,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[5362,5419,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[5584,5611,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[5644,5694,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[5890,5954,"Judgement-capacity-negative"],[6060,6073,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[6176,6190,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[6363,6384,"Judgement-propriety-negative"],[7096,7109,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[7655,7680,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[7719,7734,"Appreciation-quality-negative"],[7869,7901,"Appreciation-impact-positive"],[8047,8064,"Affect-inclination-positive"]]}
